<h1>Hello Traveller!</h1>
  <h2>How many hours of your life have you lost due to Crossrail delays? Find out below: </h2>

    Your journey currently takes <b>{{ current_journey_time }} minutes</b> <br>
    Your journey (with crossrail) will take <b>{{ crossrail_journey_time }} minutes</b> <br>
    That's a saving of <b>{{ saving_minutes_day }} minutes</b> per day <br>
    <b>{{ saving_minutes_week }} minutes</b> per week <br>
    By the time Crossrail comes around in December 2019, you will have wasted <b>{{ total_hours_wasted }} hours</b> of your life versus the alternate universe in which Crossrail started service in December 2018.
